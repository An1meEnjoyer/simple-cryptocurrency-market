# simple-cryptocurrency-market

This is simple project to trading training (?).
It is not designed for real money transactions. So pls don't use it as part of real project.

What U need to try it:
python 3, install requirements and postgres database (structure U can check in api.py comments);
this is server part, so u need [client](https://github.com/An1meEnjoyer/simple-cryptocurrency-market-client).
Then just start main.py:app and open client
